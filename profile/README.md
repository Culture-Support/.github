Dhatu (धातु) is an exceptionally powerful name for a programming language. In Sanskrit, it literally means "Root," "Element," or "Building Block." In linguistics, a Dhatu is the core verbal root from which all words are derived. For a language that compiles to Batch, this is the perfect metaphor: Dhatu provides the modern "root" logic that then expands into the complex "branches" of Batch commands.
1. The Language Spec: Dhatu
Let's design the syntax to feel like a "Modern Ancient" language—clean, structural, and rooted in logic.
Variable & Types
In Dhatu, we use dha (from dhar, to hold) to declare variables.
dha version = 1.0
dha user = "Admin"
dha isActive = true

Functions (The Roots)
Functions are the heart of Dhatu. We use the keyword mula (meaning "Source" or "Root").
mula greet(target) {
    print "Invoking Dhatu on " + target
}

Control Flow (The Path)
Instead of standard names, we use terms that reflect logical progression.
 * yadi (If)
 * anyatha (Else)
 * puna (Loop/Again)
<!-- end list -->
yadi isActive {
    greet(user)
} anyatha {
    print "System Idle"
}

2. Example Code: backup.dhatu
This script would be compiled by your "Dhatu Transpiler" into a high-performance .bat file.
// Dhatu Backup Script
dha source = "C:\Data"
dha target = "D:\Backup"

mula sync(src, dest) {
    print "Starting Dhatu Sync..."
    xcopy src dest /E /H /C /I
}

yadi exists(source) {
    sync(source, target)
}

3. The Dhatu "Ancient Pack" Standard Library
To make the language feel authentic, the built-in functions (Standard Library) can follow the Sanskrit naming convention:
| Dhatu Function | Batch Equivalent | Description |
|---|---|---|
| shunya() | cls | Clears the console (Zeroes the screen). |
| vacha(text) | echo | Prints text to the terminal. |
| stambha() | pause | Stops execution (The Pillar). |
| tyaga() | exit | Closes the script (Relinquish). |
| kala() | time /t | Returns the current time. |
4. Why Dhatu for Batch?
Batch files are often messy and hard to maintain. By using Dhatu as your front-end language:
 * Strict Roots: You define your logic clearly in mula blocks.
 * Modular: You can "import" other .dhatu files, which the compiler flattens into one Batch file.
 * Visual Clarity: You replace the ugly %VAR% and SET syntax with clean, modern declarations.
